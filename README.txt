To Compile & Run:
  1) Open a terminal window.
  2) Navigate to directory with FractalDrawer.java and related files.
  3) Enter 'javac FractalDrawer.java' in terminal to compile.
  4) Enter 'java FractalDrawer' in terminal in run program.
  5) Select shape from given options (circle, triangle, rectangle.)

Assumptions:
  - Assume users will enter one of the given shape options (circle, triangle, rectangle.)

Known Bugs or Defects:
  - Canvas does not draw all fractal elements unless resized.
  - If user enters a non-shape option, blank canvas will be drawn.
    Warning given in console, but canvas not closed.
